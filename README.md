# Personal Resume Blog powered by Raspberry Pi and Next.js

The goal of the project was to build a personal resume website to not only give myself exposure to some of the front-end delevelopment skills that I was hoping to cultivate, but also to provide a location where I could post about future projects. 

Source code adapated from the Next.js blog example. 

To access go to calebgill.com. If you receive a 502 please bear with me - it probably means the site is down for maintenance or my RPi has crashed ;)
